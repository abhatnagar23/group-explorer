This page documents the interface for the large view of a [cycle
graph](rf-groupterms.md#cycle-graph). A cycle graph is one of
*Group Explorer's* four [visualizers](rf-geterms.md#visualizers), all of
which can appear either in [group info pages](rf-um-groupwindow.md),
[sheets](rf-geterms.md#sheets), or in their own pages. When they appear in
their own pages, this is refered to as a "large view," and you can read
about it in general [here](rf-um-largewindow.md). This page covers the
specifics for large views of cycle graphs.

## Magnification

You can zoom in and out of cycle graphs with your mouse wheel.

The center of zooming is always the center of the view, so if you wish to
zoom around a different center, first click and drag to move that point to
the center of the view, then you can zoom in and out centered on that point.

To restore the default magnification level (which fits the whole cycle graph
into the view), right-click (control click on Mac) anywhere in the cycle
graph.

The controls in the right side of the large window for cycle graphs are
described in [the help page for subset controls](rf-um-subsetlistbox.md).
