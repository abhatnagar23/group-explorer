# Group Explorer 3.0

The abstract algebra visualization application *Group Explorer 2.0* has been
available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, since 2009.  You can [download it
here](http://groupexplorer.sourceforge.net), but it was last updated in
2009, and thus won't work on every modern computer.  (Though the Windows
version has held up remarkably well.)

**The point: We are updating it to run on the web.**

## Status

**Alpha**

[Try the alpha version here.](http://nathancarter.github.io/group-explorer/index.html)

Some functionality is not yet implemented and only a little testing has been
done.  You have been warned.

## Credits: Thanks, Ray!

Most of the code so far has been written by Ray Ellis, following the design
patterns and ideas in the original application's source code.  I (Nathan)
will be helping out as often as time permits, but Ray has been by far the
largest contributor so far.
