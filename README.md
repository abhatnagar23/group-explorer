# Group Explorer 3.0

Group Explorer is visualization software for students and instructors of
abstract algebra, specifically group theory.  It has been around since 2005
as a desktop application, but was rewritten in 2019 as a web app.

## Status

**Release 3.1.0:** A new Group Info page look.
Let us know what you think!

**Release 3.0.0:** First official full-featured release! It's not done yet, though.
We would still appreciate suggestions for enhancements or bug reports.

**Beta:** We would appreciate any bug reports during summer 2019, so that we
can have a polished and reliable version ready for students in Fall 2019
courses.
