# Group Explorer 3.0

The abstract algebra visualization application *Group Explorer 2.0* has been
available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, since 2009.  You can [download it
here](http://groupexplorer.sourceforge.net), but it was last updated in
2009, and thus won't work on every modern computer.  (Though the Windows
version has held up remarkably well.)

**The point: We are updating it to run on the web.**

## Status

**Alpha**

You can place it on a web server and visit the server to visualize some
groups.  But not all functionality is yet implemented, and testing and bug
fixing has been minimal so far.

We may eventually update this repository to host a copy of the application
on GitHub as well, but have not yet done so.

## Credits: Thanks, Ray!

Most of the code so far has been written by Ray Ellis, following the design
patterns and ideas in the original application's source code.  I (Nathan)
will be helping out as often as time permits.
