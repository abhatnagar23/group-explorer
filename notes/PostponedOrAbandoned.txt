Postponed:

specialize thumbnails, especially on opening page:
  small diagrams don't a need complex spheres, labels, thick lines, arrows
  but performance seems OK, let's leave it for now

literate programming: nothing widely accepted for javascript (!?)
  litpro -- extract code from .md file (into build directory)
  maked -- converts .md into .html
  vmd -- displays .md exactly as github would



Abandoned:

use web workers to improve performance:
  web workers can't modify DOM
  can't make .png without DOM <canvas> for context (and you need document to create <canvas>)
  most of our time is spent rendering, there's not much work we can offload
