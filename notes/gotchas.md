<em>A general collections of gotchas encountered in developing GE3, together with references to parts they affected. It may explain why some things were done in an unusual way.</em>


If you have an entity like "&amp;Zopf;" (&Zopf;, double-strike Z) in an XML file without defining it (as in a DTD), the browser's built-in XML parser will fail to parse it.  All the XML group definition files have such entities. Get around this by replacing the string "$amp;Zopf;" with "&amp;#8484;", its unicode character code. See [XMLGroup](../js/XMLGroup.js), around line 29.


There is a limit to the number of html canvas elements a browser can handle: having one canvas for each thumbnail in the GroupExplorer opening page easily exceeds that number. To work around this limitation only a few canvases are used. The thumbnails are drawn to the canvas and the data extracted in png format, which is then displayed in an &lt;img&gt; element. See the [GroupExplorer](../GroupExplorer.html) calls to `getImage` in the `displayGroup` function.


There is a limit to the size of a canvas, depending on the browser. It's 2^14-1 pixels square on Chrome/Ubuntu, others browser/systems are comparable. This caused initial implementations of the [Multtable](../Multtable.html) and [CycleDiagram](../CycleDiagram.html) visualizers to be unable to display larger groups, like the 168.group.  This in turn informed the design of the [DisplayCycleGraph](../js/DisplayCycleGraph.js) and [DisplayMulttable](../js/DisplayMulttable.js) classes and their interfaces.


You can have fractional-sized fonts (who knew?). For example `context.font = '0.7pt Arial';` is OK. There are limitations, though:
* They can't be smaller than 0.008pt for Arial in Chrome/Ubuntu, and similar for other browsers/systems and fonts.
* You can't use something like `` context.font = `${3/7}pt Arial`; ``, you've got to convert it to a fixed representation with the expression `` context.font = `${(3/7).toFixed(6)}pt Arial`; `` (6 isn't magic, other numbers work too).
* You've got to use pt, not px in the font spec for fractional fonts, thus: `context.font = '0.7pt Arial'`. While the way they fail varies, no browser/system combination seems to work completely without error if you don't use pt.
See [DisplayCycleGraph](../js/DisplayCycleGraph.js) at the end of the `showLargeGraphic` routine for an example.


Drag-and-drop was surprisingly consistent. A couple of small-ish exceptions:
* Across platforms Firefox has an odd pre-condition: you have to set the data in the `event.dataTransfer` object, thus: `event.originalEvent.dataTransfer.setData('text/plain', 'anything');`.  It doesn't seem to be used for anything, you just have to do it.
* The image drag on Chrome/Ubuntu doesn't work, a bug in that browser/system.
You can see the effect of these in [CycleDiagram](../CycleDiagram.html) in the `dragstart` routine.

    
THREE.js raycasting works with lines, but it doesn't work with meshLines, and you need meshlines to display anything thicker than about a pixel in any browser except Safari. Workaround in [DisplayDiagram](../js/DisplayDiagram.js) is to set `Diagram3D.lineWidth` to 1, run `DisplayDiagram.updateLines(..)`, and then restore previous lineWidth. Since the scene is never rendered with the skinny lines, the user never sees it; and it only happens on the grab.


MathJax can be configured to break lines automatically (cf. http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/options/output-processors/CommonHTML.html ), but it is not fast enough to keep up with something like resizing the subset display panel. In addition it executes asynchronously, so if you need to know the size of the text in order to proceed (as when formatted text is included in a menu which must be placed on the page) the programming is a bit convoluted. The browser is much more performant when re-flowing text, so you can compose lines with MathML in them out of smaller pieces of relatively indivisible <math>...</math> chunks and let MathJax do the formatting and let the browser do the text placement. Setting MathML next to browser fonts is generally not pretty, so it's usually best to make the whole line MathML chunks, not a mixture of the two.


Rather than having MathJax re-generate a phrase every time you use it, you can copy the HTML generated by MathJax from one place to another. You have to be sure the &lt;style&gt; defining `mjx-chtml` is available, either from a previous MathJax formatting run (which creates it) or by copying it from a previous session. (There's no documentation that indicates this definition is the same across browsers/systems/devices, so saving it to a local file and distributing it with the release might not work. The implementation here is to copy it to local storage from the DOM on the first visit to the site, and then restore it in later runs. The first run doesn't need it because there are no previous MathJax results that need to be styled.) 
In the interest of saving space you really only need to copy part of the generated HTML, the top &lt;span&gt; with class `mjx-chtml` and its sub-span with class `mjx-math`. A problem came up doing this, though: mixing the partial HTML copy with new MathML for MathJax to process confuses MathJax. The workaround in GroupExplorer is to stage the new MathML in a hidden scratch area and process it there, then copy it to the normal visible area on completion.

Firefox (65.0.1) seems to ignore the size of a parent flex container if it's expressed as %. Since the container is going to be flexed anyhow, the workaround here is just to give it some value to work from.
