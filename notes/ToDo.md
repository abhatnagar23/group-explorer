# Ray's List

## General

 * GE help integration
 * Internal documentation
 * Rationalize coding style (add leading underscore to internal methods?)
 * Re-factor to hide internal implementations (e.g., js/DisplayXX classes)

## CayleyDiagram diagram panel

 * Hover help in big Cayley diagram (including chunking)
 * Keep labels from disappearing behind nodes with changing node/label sizes
 * Change label representations in visualizers?
 * Display raw element numbers for debugging?
 * Follow up approach in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15558418/how-do-you-save-an-image-from-a-three-js-canvas for saving buffer
 * Add indication to Subgroups panel that subgroup is normal?

## Local files

# Nathan's List

 * Sheets
    * Morphisms
       * I must insert a plan here.
    * Extend the toJSON() and fromJSON() in CayleyDiagram.html to also respect:
       * node colors: `Cayley_diagram.nodes[i].nodeColor` then same update routine or `updateHighlights()`
         (Is this the same as node highlights?)
       * diagram name: global var in HTML page, `Diagram_name`, plus the
         drop-down selector with id `'#diagram-select'` (then `displayGraphic()`)
       * all the rest of the Diagram panel needs to wait until I talk to Ray
       * background color:
         `Graphic_context.renderer.getClearColor().toArray()` and
         `new THREE.Color( that_array[0], that_array[1], that_array[2] )`
       * node positions: `Cayley_diagram.nodes[i].point.x` (y, z), then update diagram with `updateNodes()`
       * node radii: `Cayley_diagram.nodes[i].radius` then same (original) update routine
       * arc curvature: once it's implemented later
       * chunking: once it's implemented later
 * Rename Cycle Diagram HTML page to Cycle Graph instead
 * Add an object of symmetry for Z_1: something with no symmetry
 * Design how permalinks to GE resources should work and add a plan for
   implementation.  Goal: As many things as possible should be linkable
   directly so that students, instructors, etc. can just copy the URL as if
   it were Google maps and paste it into an email, and anyone can jump right
   to the visualization the first user was seeing.
 * Consider how to improve the default style of the three visualizations:
    * Remove colored background from all three?
    * Investigate drawing Cycle Graphs with SVGs; let the browser do the
      rendering optimizations and get free vector graphics as a result.
    * Investigate how to get Cayley Diagrams to look more like VGT and less
      like GE2.0.
    * Consider how to create an exporter for 3D Cayley Diagrams to SVGs,
      for users to download for use in contexts where they want vector graphics.
       * [Recall your 3D SVG library](https://github.com/nathancarter/svg3d)
    * Consider letting them also download PDF versions.  Note that PDFKit can
      do this if you have SVGs first; or you can skip SVGs and go stright to
      PDFs instead.  Either way, here are some useful links:
       * [Demo PDF made by PDFKit](https://github.com/foliojs/pdfkit/blob/master/demo/out.pdf)
         (See last page on which a tiger SVG is embedded.)
       * [The source code that created the tiger page](https://github.com/foliojs/pdfkit/blob/83f5f7243172a017adcf6a7faa5547c55982c57b/demo/test.js#L48)

# Anyone's List (as yet unclaimed)

## Features

 * Get the following stuff into the heading on the main page:
    * Simple logo, w/version number
    * Contributors' names
    * Link to help files (or to help stub if they're not yet done)
    * [GitHub icon](https://github.com/logos) linking to this
      source code repository
 * Improve the Subgroups view so that instead of using HTML with MathJax
   inside, the entire "H_{index} = < element names >" portion is MathJax.
 * Change &lt;select&gt; elements that use formatted math strings to use hand-rolled menus
   with mathml instead of text (similar to menus in Subgroups view)

## Bug fixes
 * Table on main page does not show which column is sorted at first (until you click one).
 * Setting line thickness to minimum does not work; it gets reset to a thicker value.
 * Render multiple-character element names in same font as single-character names. (By default, MathJax renders
   single-character elements in italic, multiple-character in normal font, so you get odd-looking element
   names like &#x27E8;<i>e</i>,fr&#x27E9; in D<sub>4</sub> x &Zopf;<sub>2</sub>.)
 * Eliminate juxtapositions of dissimilar fonts in, e.g., visualizer titles (perhaps make entire title mathml?)
 * Adjust radial scaling in, e.g., A_5 generated by `[(0 1 2 3 4),0,0,0][(0 1)(2 3),2,0,1]`
 * Fix test for circular/rotary layout in `CayleyDiagram.setStrategies`
