# Nathan's List

 * Sheets
    * Extend the toJSON() and fromJSON() in CayleyDiagram.html to also respect:
       * all the rest of the Diagram panel needs to wait until I talk to Ray
       * background color:
         `Graphic_context.renderer.getClearColor().toArray()` and
         `new THREE.Color( that_array[0], that_array[1], that_array[2] )`
       * diagram name: global var in HTML page, `Diagram_name`, plus the
         drop-down selector with id `'#diagram-select'` (then `displayGraphic()`)
       * node positions: `Cayley_diagram.nodes[i].point.x` (y, z), then update diagram with `updateNodes()`
       * node radii: `Cayley_diagram.nodes[i].radius` then same (original) update routine
       * arc curvature: once I talk to Ray
       * chunking: once I talk to Ray
    * In ZmnInfo.html:
       * Create a function `showZnmIsomorphism(n,m)` that pops up a sheet with the following
         content and a suitable title.  (This works only if n and m are relatively prime.)
          * Left column: A Cayley Diagram of Z_n x Z_m with generators a of order n and b of order m,
            under which is text stating exactly that.
          * Center column: The same Cayley Diagram, now with arrows also added for the element ab,
            under which is text stating exactly that.
          * Right column: A Cayley Diagram of Z_{nm} with cyclic arrangement of nodes, under which is
            text stating that if you unroll the ab cycle from the previous diagram and drop the a and b
            arrows, this is what you get, which is obviously Z_{nm}.
       * Replace the "not implemented" text in the page with links to a sheet showing this content
         for each type of visualizer.
       * Create a function `showNoZnmIsomorphism(n,m)` that pops up a sheet with the following
         content and a suitable title.  (This works only if n and m are not relatively prime.)
          * Left and center columns the same as those produced by `showZnmIsomorphism(n,m)`.
          * Right column: A Cayley Diagram of Z_n x Z_m generated by <ab,b> with the axis for ab being
            cyclic in x,y and the axis for b being linear in z.  Show the ab arrow, do not show b.
            Look at it from diagonally above so that we can see multiple rings in perspective.
            The text below it says that untangling the ab arrows from the second column clearly shows
            that the result is not a single cycle of length nm.
       * Add links at the end of the page that offer to show this type of sheet using any type of
         visualizer.
    * Design problem: Sheets cannot grow or scroll.  Some auto-generated sheets stick off the
      right or bottom of the window.
    * Bug fix: Visualizers created programmatically (through `CreateNewSheet()`) don't propagate
      changes back from their editor version in the new tab.
    * Bug fix: The Help button at the bottom of the sheet controls pane is not visible without
      scrolling.
 * Rename Cycle Diagram HTML page to Cycle Graph instead
 * Add an object of symmetry for Z_1: something with no symmetry
 * Design how permalinks to GE resources should work and add a plan for
   implementation.  Goal: As many things as possible should be linkable
   directly so that students, instructors, etc. can just copy the URL as if
   it were Google maps and paste it into an email, and anyone can jump right
   to the visualization the first user was seeing.
 * Consider how to improve the default style of the three visualizations:
    * Remove colored background from all three?
    * Investigate drawing Cycle Graphs with SVGs; let the browser do the
      rendering optimizations and get free vector graphics as a result.
    * Investigate how to get Cayley Diagrams to look more like VGT and less
      like GE2.0.
    * Consider how to create an exporter for 3D Cayley Diagrams to SVGs,
      for users to download for use in contexts where they want vector graphics.
       * [Recall your 3D SVG library](https://github.com/nathancarter/svg3d)
    * Consider letting them also download PDF versions.  Note that PDFKit can
      do this if you have SVGs first; or you can skip SVGs and go stright to
      PDFs instead.  Either way, here are some useful links:
       * [Demo PDF made by PDFKit](https://github.com/foliojs/pdfkit/blob/master/demo/out.pdf)
         (See last page on which a tiger SVG is embedded.)

# Anyone's List (as yet unclaimed)

## Features

 * Get the following stuff into the heading on the main page:
    * Simple logo, w/version number
    * Contributors' names
    * Link to help files (or to help stub if they're not yet done)
    * [GitHub icon](https://github.com/logos) linking to this
      source code repository
 * Improve the Subgroups view so that instead of using HTML with MathJax
   inside, the entire "H_{index} = < element names >" portion is MathJax.
 * Change &lt;select&gt; elements that use formatted math strings to use hand-rolled menus
   with mathml instead of text (similar to menus in Subgroups view)
 * Change the default so that navigating into a group's Group Info page doesn't use a
   blob URL, but the group URL, so that users can share links to such pages the usual way.

## Bug fixes
 * Setting line thickness to minimum does not work; it gets reset to a thicker value.
 * Render multiple-character element names in same font as single-character names. (By default, MathJax renders
   single-character elements in italic, multiple-character in normal font, so you get odd-looking element
   names like &#x27E8;<i>e</i>,fr&#x27E9; in D<sub>4</sub> x &Zopf;<sub>2</sub>.)
 * Eliminate juxtapositions of dissimilar fonts in, e.g., visualizer titles (perhaps make entire title mathml?)
 * Adjust radial scaling in, e.g., A_5 generated by `[(0 1 2 3 4),0,0,0][(0 1)(2 3),2,0,1]`
 * Fix test for circular/rotary layout in `CayleyDiagram.setStrategies`
 * Some element names are shown in non-math font.  For example, fr and rf in S_3.
 * Many subgroup images on the subgroup info page do not load, and show the "broken image" icon.
