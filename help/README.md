# Generated help files

# <font color=red>THIS FOLDER IS NOT TO BE EDITED!</font>

All files in this folder are generated by the source files in the
`help-src` folder (a sibling of this `help` folder).

Although it is generally bad practice to include generated files
in a repository, in this case the repository is serving the dual
role of also being the project's website on GitHub.  Consequently,
generated web site files need to be included.

But you should *NOT* edit the files in this folder, because any
such edits will be overwritten the next time the help files are
rebuilt from sources.  Instead, edit the corresponding source
files in the `help-src` folder, then rebuild the documentation as
indicated by the `README.md` file in that folder.
