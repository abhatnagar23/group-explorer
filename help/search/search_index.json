They also clearly show the group as acting on itself. If you have not yet encountered the multiplication table visualizer , start with these help pages: The definition of a Cayley diagram The documentation on the Cayley diagram interface in Group Explorer What Cayley diagrams do well The Cayley diagram is the only visualizer in Group Explorer with the following two useful properties. Each element in the group is represented by a unique item in the visualizer. Full information about the group structure is immediately visible in the diagram. Cycle graphs also satisfy the first of these requirements but not the second. Multiplication tables satisfy the second but not the first. Consider the Cayley diagram of S_3 shown below. There is a node in the diagram for each element of the group and all information for determining the structure of the group can be immediately seen (or sometimes inferred) from the arrows connecting the nodes. The fact that a red arrow goes from f to fr indicates that the red arrows signify right-multiplication by the generator r . So one can see how two generators (the red arrows meaning r and the blue-green arcs meaning f ) combine to create all the structure of the group. Following a red arrow and then a blue-green one will lead you to a different location than following a blue-green arrow and then a red one; in this way one can see that S_3 is not abelian. Some groups in Group Explorer come with a human-designed Cayley diagram that has a particular beauty or symmetry which best shows off the symmetry inherent in the group. Such diagrams are included if the standard algorithms Group Explorer uses for auto-generating Cayley diagrams do not yield aesthetically good results for that group. Here are two particularly pleasing Cayley diagrams. A Cayley diagram for the group S_4 Node color is highlighted to indicate membership in cosets of the subgroup \\langle(1~2~3)\\rangle . A Cayley diagram for the group A_5 Node color is highlighted to indicate membership in cosets of the subgroup \\langle(0~1~2~3~4)\\rangle . There are some illustrations can be made from just about any kind of visualization, including Cayley diagrams. For instance, although this lattice of subgroups and this short exact sequence of groups use multiplication tables, they could just as easily have used Cayley diagrams instead.

After reading these pages, you re encouraged to either start playing with the software on your own or use the Tutorials to continue the guided tour. What illustrations can you do in group theory? Group theory is a subject that has historically had very few pictures, and when it did (such as wallpaper groups or polyhedra) they served only to exemplify a few select groups, and indirectly. Thus it was possible for a student to have a year or more of abstract algebra without ever picturing the subject in his or her head! This is a loss for any group theory student, and is a particular roadblock to visual learners. Since about 2004, there have been a growing number of resources for learning group theory in a more visual way. Group Explorer is one of them. It provides interactive visualizations for group theory and is designed to be an aid for building intuition and understanding for students as they learn. But it may also offer some new intuitions for those seasoned in algebra as well. A brief overview of its features are given below. Multiplication tables (or Cayley tables) These are a common introduction point for new students into binary operations and groups. Group Explorer allows users to view them, highlight them, compare them, draw homomorphisms between them, take quotients of them, and more. See an example multiplication table here Read more about multiplication tables here Cayley diagrams These are a less common but more potent group visualization tool and are the flagship intuition-building device used in Group Explorer. Cayley diagrams expose the structure of a group and the relationships between its elements and generators. These, too, can be viewed, highlighted, connected by homomorphisms, etc. See an example Cayley diagram here Read more about Cayley diagrams here Other visualization techniques Symmetry objects are very common and cycle graphs are very rare, but both are also integrated in Group Explorer. See an example object of symmetry here See an example cycle graph here These help pages allow the student to be guided by the software on their explorations and investigations in group theory. Group Explorer s group library is the perfect place to start for building conjectures or finding counterexamples.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"gs-index/#what-illustrations-can-you-do-in-group-theory","text":"Group theory is a subject that has historically had very few pictures, and when it did (such as wallpaper groups or polyhedra) they served only to exemplify a few select groups, and indirectly.

Let s take a look at some of its potential. If you have not yet encountered the multiplication table visualizer , start with these help pages: The definition of a multiplication table The documentation on the multiplication table interface in Group Explorer What multiplication tables do well Coloring the backgrounds of multiplication tables cells reveals patterns in the group operation. Let s illustrate this by contrasting a bad example with a good one. Bad example The backgrounds of the cells in this multiplication table are colored based on whether they are in a particular 2-element subgroup. This does not look as helpful in a multiplication table as it does in a cycle graph or Cayley diagram , because each element appears multiple times in a multiplication table. Good example The backgrounds of the cells in this multiplication table are colored based on their membership in the cosets of the subgroup highlighted in red. This shows how the group operation in this example respects the cosets nicely in fact, by considering each block of like-colored neighbors as one big cell, one can see the multiplication table of the quotient group ! The subgroup in question is therefore normal . Exercise Consider it an exercise to find a group with a non-normal subgroup and highlight a multiplication table of that group by the cosets of the non-normal subgroup. There are some illustrations can be made from just about any kind of visualization, including multiplication tables.

Try double-clicking them to learn more about them. If you need help, each page of the application has help links in the top right corner that go to the specific portion of the help files relevant to that page. This window is a typical help window. Search help from the menu or toolbar above. Group Explorer is all about visualization. To see some of the images, click a group from the library page and then click one of the pictures you see. Or try one of these links: Example group info file Example visualization New to version 3.0? New features in this version: The application is now on the web! This is the first update in about ten years - wow! You do not need to install anything to start using Group Explorer right away. To share with anyone else an image or other information in the software, just copy the URL from the top of your browser and share it however you like (email, blog, text message, etc.). The user interface and help files have all seen significant updates as part of the process of converting the application to the web. In particular, this is the first update of the software since Visual Group Theory was published, and thus the help now contains references to material in the text (and on related websites) that supplement what you can get from the software. Thanks to the newest developer on the Group Explorer team, Ray Ellis, who pioneered most of the work of converting the app to the web. There are sure to be bugs in version 3.0, because it is so new. Please feel free to report them using the project s issue tracker . Many updates are planned for versions 3.1, 3.2, and so on, so check back later for more.","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"welcome/#new-to-group-explorer","text":"Group Explorer is a piece of software for visualizing the mathematical objects known as groups.
